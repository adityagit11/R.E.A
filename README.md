# R.E.A
Redundancy Elimination Algorithm

![alt text](https://github.com/adityasingh11/R.E.A/blob/master/Untitled.jpg)

Based on C.E. Shannon formulae.

This algorithm calculates the most redundant user on the basis of data transmission consistency. 

Redundant User - User. 5 and User. 3
Highest usefull (most priority) User - User. 2
